# MOC
This document describes the Multi-Order Coverage map method (MOC) to specify arbitrary coverages for sky regions and/or time coverages and potentially other dimensions. The goal is to be able to provide a very fast comparison mechanism between coverages. The mechanism is based on a discretization of space and time dimensions. The system is based on the definition of a specific storage of the map coverage using predefined cells hierarchically grouped which makes it easy to produce and use for exploring astronomical collections. There are already a few applications and libraries which are taking advantage of this new standard.
