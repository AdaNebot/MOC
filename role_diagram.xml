<!--
Document authors (ivoatex maintainers have different rules):

* svn cp this file to role_diagram.xml, and then:

* Remove all <rec> elements in there referring to standards not related
  to the current one,

* change the tag name for the current one from rec to thisrec

* make role_diagram.pdf

For the time being, keep both role_diagram.pdf and role_diagram.svg as
created by this in the VCS.  This helps document builds on machines
with missing dependencies.
